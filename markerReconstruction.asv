    % We add 1 to the end of the point in order to make it a 1x4 vector
    % which will make it easier for future calculations
    pointA = [pointA]
    % Since we are transforming point from the detector, destination frame
    % v, to CK frame, home frame (h), we inverse the tranformation frame
    % from home to destination in order to get
